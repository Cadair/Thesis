* Questions on Chapter 1: Introduction
** DONE Modified  sentence to remove ambiguity. %%p.1, l.-1: this is a ‚Äòstrange‚Äô definition of photosphere, at least for me! What is the source of this definition? And what is the relation to the optical depth = 1 definition?
CLOSED: [2016-01-25 Mon 10:54]
** DONE Add semi-empirical to the caption %%Fig.1.2: what is observed and what is calculated from a model? what model? how is the temperature observed?
CLOSED: [2016-01-25 Mon 11:18]
** DONE rephrase %%p.4, l.4: you call coronal loops ‚Äòmassive‚Äô (= consisting of or forming a large mass; bulky and heavy). Are they?
CLOSED: [2016-01-25 Mon 11:19]
** DONE Small change, further discussion on ionisation to come later. %%p.4, l.5: you claim the plasma in the solar atmosphere is ‚Äòperfectly conducting‚Äô. Is this true? In all the atmosphere? what about the photosphere and corona where the ionization degree is 0.01%?
CLOSED: [2016-01-25 Mon 11:30]
** DONE Re-written this whole paragraph to postpone the ambiguity to chapter 2. %%p4., l.10: you claim the plasma in the photosphere is tied to the magnetic field. But there not only the ionization degree is only 0.01%, but also the density is so high that for ions the collision frequency is four orders of magnitude larger than the gyro frequency, I.e. the ions collide 10.000 times in one turn around the magnetic field line. SO they are ‚Äòunmagnetized‚Äô!?
CLOSED: [2016-01-25 Mon 12:09]
** DONE %%p.4, l.-6: the statement on magnetic reconnection contradicts the previous statement on perfectly conducting plasma‚Ä¶?
CLOSED: [2016-01-25 Mon 12:09]
** DONE %%p.6, l.4: plasma and magnetic field are locked together in MHD simulations of the motions in the photosphere, but this is by definition (MHD). Can we be sure it is also true on the real Sun, given the remarks above?
CLOSED: [2016-01-25 Mon 12:09]
** DONE Add a caveat to this sentence and again punt to CH 2 %%p.6, l.-7: There are two problems with this statement on ‚Äòalmost certainly driven MHD waves‚Äô: the non-magnetization of the ions and electrons due to the enormous collision frequencies as mentioned above if MHD waves are generated at all, they should be dissipated extremely efficiently due to the high viscosity/high collision frequency in the photosphere and lower chromosphere!?
CLOSED: [2016-01-25 Mon 12:16]

* Questions on Chapter 2: Background
** TODO  %%p.7, middle: can you give an idea on the typical time and length scales in the photosphere/chromosphere/corona and what you mean by ‚Äòsufficiently large‚Äô then?
** TODO  %%You should include a quantitative check of the satisfaction of the assumptions to show the MHD model can indeed be used in this situation, i.e. all the assumptions that are made to derive the MHD equations are satisfied!
** TODO  %%p.7, l.-6: are the relative velocities of positive and negative charges small, given the statements above and the large discrepancy between the mass of electrons and ions?
** DONE Fixed. %%Eq.(2.4): the B should be in bold as it is a vector!
CLOSED: [2016-01-25 Mon 14:01]
** TODO  %%p.8,l.-11: you mention ‚Äòa wide variety of wave modes in plasma‚Äô(cf. Jess et al. 2015), but a few lines down you claim there are only 3 wave modes? Where did the other go?
** TODO  %%Actually, in the real Sun the situation is far more complex. When inhomogeneity of the plasma is taken into account, the MHD wave spectrum includes continuous parts with singular wave mode solutions. Did this not come up and cause problems in the simulations? The waves should phase-mix as they propagate along the magnetic field lines, especially in the case of the circular driver, when you impose a phi-component only, i.e. directly drive an Alfv√©n wave‚Ä¶
** TODO  %%Eq.(2.7): you perturb a static plasma while the coronal plasma is all but static. Can you elaborate on the effects/complications of background flow, and the consequences of ignoring it in the model?
** DONE Fixed %%p.9, Eq.(2.11): B1 should be bold face as it is a vector!
CLOSED: [2016-01-25 Mon 14:02]
** DONE Fixed by explaining notation. %%p.10, Eq.(2.16): to get this simple form of decoupled equations you have to consider a coordinate system chosen such that the (x.z)-plane is the plane determined by the wave vector k and the magnetic field B. If ky is not equal to zero, the equations are coupled!
CLOSED: [2016-01-25 Mon 13:52]
** DONE Fixed by explaining notation. %%p.10, Eq.(2.16): also, you seem to use cylindrical coordinates? what is the meaning of phi then, as I though phi is the perpendicular direction!!
CLOSED: [2016-01-25 Mon 13:51]
** DONE This is fixed by correctly explaining the notation convention. It is in fact in Cartesian coordinates. %%there should be curvature term in the equation (2.16) when you use cylindrical coordinates!
CLOSED: [2016-01-25 Mon 13:51]
** TODO  %%p.10, Eq.(2.17): the definition of k is WRONG! There is a square root missing‚Ä¶ (see p.199, Eq.(5.53) Goedbloed and Poedts, 2004).
** DONE Fixed in Eq (2.16), component notation was incorrect. %%p.11, l.5: this is WRONG! According to Eq.(2.16), only the perpendicular component is non-vanishing for Alfv√©n waves‚Ä¶!?
CLOSED: [2016-01-25 Mon 14:03]
** DONE Fixed %%p.12,Eq.(2.28) should end with a dot (end of sentence).
CLOSED: [2016-01-25 Mon 14:03]
** TODO  %%p.12,equation before Eq.(2.32) is WRONG: there is a delta missing in the second RHS term!?
** TODO  %%p.12,Eqs.(2.32-2.34) are WRONG: there should be minus signs in the second term in the RHS in each of these equations.
** TODO  %%p.15, end of 2.1.2: so the polarization is exactly opposite as in a low-beta plasma?
** TODO  %%p.15, l.-1: the vector product is WRONG as you multiply a vector with a scalar!?
** DONE Changed all notation up to this point to use this notation. %%p.15, section 2.1.3: why this sudden change of notation with tildes on the perturbed ? = B1‚Ä¶? and v = v1? quantities? I guess you mean Bb = B0 and ùêÅùêÅ
CLOSED: [2016-01-25 Mon 13:49]
** TODO  %%P.15, Eq.(2.66): this I a second order equation/quantity, is this OK since you linearized the equations before!? Linear is first order‚Ä¶ Actually, why do you consider only the second order form of this wave flux, instead of the full nonlinear form?
** TODO  %%And why do you not simply consider the Poynting flux???
** TODO  %%What about the plasma density in this model? How does it look/behave?
** TODO  %%p.18,Eq.(2.72): I think the central difference scheme in this equation is ONLY 3rd order accurate, not 4th?
** TODO  %%p.18, the section on numerical stability is a bit mysterious to me. Are you refereeing to the CFL condition due to the explicitness of the scheme? Are the ‚Äòadditional terms‚Äô you mention involving some artificial dissipation?
** DONE Fixed.%%p.19, section 2.3: here you seem to use the alternative notation again for background and linear perturbation? or is this not the linear perturbation?
CLOSED: [2016-01-25 Mon 15:43]
** DONE Fixed.%%p.19, Eq.(2.75) there is a scalar product dot (\cdot) too much in the RHS.
CLOSED: [2016-01-25 Mon 15:42]

* Questions on Chapter 3: Methodology
** DONE Expanded description around solving pressure balance %%p.21-23: To maintain the HD equilibrium, the added magnetic field should be potential, or at least force-free. Is it?
CLOSED: [2016-02-12 Fri 11:10]
** DONE This is only true in the background conditions description added about the generality of the method.%%p.27: is v_perp not simply v_phi x v_par? The background field is kept constant, right? and you have the magnetic field analytically, so the perpendicular direction can be determined analytically!
CLOSED: [2016-02-12 Fri 11:50]
** DONE This is also only true for the background conditions where the analytical solution is known.%%p.28-29: Why do you not simply use flux coordinates? These can readily be constructed since you have the analytic expressions for the magnetic field, and the background is constant anyway!?
CLOSED: [2016-02-12 Fri 11:50]
** DONE In fact, how do you keep the background fixed? Do you use this B0+B1 decomposition or something similar but for all variables?
CLOSED: [2016-02-12 Fri 11:50]

* Questions on Chapter 4: MHD waves excited by different photospheric motions
** DONE Notation fixed.%%p.34: I do not understand this driver. The velocity is a VECTOR field but Eq.(4.1) seems to define a scalar field!? What are the components of the velocity in the different cases? In your slides (short presentation at the viva) you actually had vectors, but this should be also corrected in the thesis text.
CLOSED: [2016-02-12 Fri 13:30]
** DONE Fixed.%%p.34-35: Actually, also in the following equations (4.2)-(4.4) your notations is WRONG as these are the components of the vector field F, so F(x) should be Fx and F(y) = Fy.
CLOSED: [2016-02-12 Fri 13:31]
** DONE Added a couple of caveats before describing the driving equations.%%p.34: You cited a paper of Bonet observing spiraling down flows in intergranular lanes which are the inspiration for the spiral driver profiles you considered. However, Bonet did not report oscillatory spiraling down flows, did he? Yet, you assume such profiles. Are these not highly artificial, i.e. is such time-dependent (oscillatory) behavior with such a complex profile not highly unlikely to occur in the real photosphere?
CLOSED: [2016-02-12 Fri 14:18]
** DONE Comment added to clarify.%%In fact, you did not consider down flows at all, rather horizontal and vertical and spiraling flows. The latter are also purely horizontal is it not? So no down flows at all!!?
CLOSED: [2016-02-12 Fri 14:33]
** DONE This is already said to be arbitrary in the manuscript.%%p.34-35:why 240 sec periods? I thought 5 min (and 3 min) where most common?
CLOSED: [2016-02-12 Fri 14:36]
** TODO p.34-35: the 10 m/s at bottom yield up to 300 m/s at 1.5 Mm height (see Fig.4.3). What is the corresponding perturbation of the magnetic field? Is it still small (linear!?) compared to the background field? You assumed they are linear everywhere!?
** DONE This is attributed to the coupling of the waves, due to the complex magnetic field geometry. (Already in text)%%p.38 and Fig.4.3a: horizontal is perpendicular, right? On page 10 you showed that the Alfv√©n waves decouples form the acoustic waves. You are driving the slow wave here directly. So why is the Alfv√©n wave excited in this case?
CLOSED: [2016-02-12 Fri 15:02]
** DONE N/A%%p.38 and Fig.4.3b: vertical is parallel (vertical field), right? On page 15 you claimed the fast mode perturbs mostly the parallel component of the velocity. So this is the one you drive directly in Fig.4.3b (vertical = parallel to B))? So why is the Alfv√©n wave dominant in the response? You write in the text that the phi component is ‚Äòsubstantially weaker than the two other components‚Äô, but this is clearly not true!!? This turns out to be a scaling problem, the color scale is different in the different plots!!! 
CLOSED: [2016-02-12 Fri 15:18]
** DONE Added small clarification. Again the scaling on the plots are important.%%p.38 and Fig.4.3c-e: how do you explain the asymmetry in these cases (much more asymmetric response than the others)? Also, you claim in the text that for these three torsional driving cases the vast majority of the perturbation is in the phi component. This is not true as it seems to me that the perpendicular component is dominant!? Or is this just an impression from the larger colored areas in the plots? 
CLOSED: [2016-02-12 Fri 15:45]
** TODO What are the solid and dashed and dotted lines in these plots?
** TODO p.46, Fig.4.5: how come there is no AW flux in the horizontal and vertical driving case while these waves are clearly visible in the velocity height-time plots?

* Questions on Chapter 5: Effects of expansion factor
** DONE Added comment referencing chapter 4%%p.51, Fig.5.1: the profile observed by Bonet is a continuous down flow profile, i.e. not oscillatory, or not?
CLOSED: [2016-02-12 Fri 14:40]
** TODO p.51, bottom: you mention a second superimposed perturbation traveling at slow speed. This is presumably because you only implemented boundary conditions on the velocity field. What BCs did you impose for the magnetic field components?
** TODO Fig.5.3e, p.56: Are you sure the panels have not been interchanged. For BL = 1.5 the velocity is almost radial (see Fig.5.2.c), so one would expect most energy in the perpendicular component (which is the radial component here , is it not?), and not in the phi component which is almost perpendicular to that, and so should receive almost no energy‚Ä¶!?
** TODO P.61, Fig.5.5: Again, it is strange that her for BL = 1.5 most energy seems to go to the fast (parallel) component!? Even though you are driving horizontally in this case, or not?

* Questions on Chapter 6: Effects on period
** TODO The effect of the driving motions on the excitation of MHD waves actually depends on the oscillation spectrum of the MBP structure you are modeling. Do you have any idea of the eigenvalue spectrum of this configuration?
** TODO Do you have any idea on how it could be computed, i.e. how you could formulate the problem as an eigenvalue problem instead of an initial value problem?
** TODO p.65, Eq.(6.3): again, the velocity field is a vector field, what are the components of this vector field? You seem to define only a scalar field here? Correct this, like you did in your slides during the viva!
** TODO p.70, Fig.6.2: It had occurred to me earlier but in these figures it is more apparent that in the phi and perpendicular components of the velocity you do not get an oscillatory response at all!? As a matter of fact, the phi component does not become positive and the perpendicular component does not become negative. So in these components the response is more like a series of pulses, rather than an oscillatory wave. Only in the parallel component you seem to get oscillations!?
** TODO p.80, Fig.6.4: I do not understand the contrast of this figure with Fig.5.5. In fact, the case P = 180 s is the same as in Fig.5.5, right? But the results seem different here? Now the phi component is by far the most energetic while it used to be comparable to the parallel component in Fig.5.5. What happened?

* Questions on Chapter 7: Conclusions and future work
** TODO What if the driver would be on B instead of on v? It should be equivalent in ideal MHD. But did you try it?
** TODO p.81, bottom: again, you did not fit the observed spiraling inter-granular lane flows as these are flows, not oscillations!!?
** TODO p.83: What about the effects of partial ionization? You think it is not important? The ionization degree is only 10-4 in the photosphere‚Ä¶!
** TODO And what about nonlinear effects? It is not clear if the linearization is justified here. For larger perturbations you surely will get shock waves developing here. Are these observed?
** TODO And what about trying to calculate the entire spectrum of a MBP? In fact, could this be done by just giving it a random initial perturbation and then Fourier analyzing the response? The eigenmodes should all be excited this way‚Ä¶

* Remark:
I have the impression that some of the effects seen in the response of the MBP
model are due to the way the driver is implemented, i.e. only on the velocity components
and no BCs on the magnetic field components. The results will be different if the BC are
consistently programmed on both B and v, only then e.g. you can drive pure Alfv√©n waves.
