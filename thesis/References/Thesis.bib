@article{Bogdan2003,
  title = {Waves in the Magnetized Solar Atmosphere. {II}. Waves from Localized Sources in Magnetic Flux Concentrations},
  volume = {599},
  abstract = {Numerical simulations of wave propagation in a two-dimensional stratified magneto-atmosphere are
resented for conditions that are representative of the solar photosphere and chromosphere. Both the
mergent magnetic flux and the extent of the wave source are spatially localized at the lower photospheric
oundary of the simulation. The calculations show that the coupling between the fast and slow magneto-
coustic-gravity (MAG) waves is confined to thin quasi{\textendash}one-dimensional atmospheric layers where the
ound speed and the Alfve \'n velocity are comparable in magnitude. Away from this wave conversion zone,
hich we call the magnetic canopy, the two MAG waves are effectively decoupled because either the magnetic
ressure (B2=8) or the plasma pressure (p 1⁄4 NkB T) dominates over the other. The character of the
uctuations observed in the magneto-atmosphere depend sensitively on the relative location and orientation
f the magnetic canopy with respect to the wave source and the observation point. Several distinct wave
ains may converge on and simultaneously pass through a given location. Their coherent superposition
resents a bewildering variety of Doppler and intensity time series because (1) some waves come directly from
he source while others emerge from the magnetic canopy following mode conversion, (2) the propagation
irections of the individual wave trains are neither co-aligned with each other nor with the observer's line of
ght, and (3) the wave trains may be either fast or slow MAG waves that exhibit different characteristics
epending on whether they are observed in high- or low- plasmas (  8p=B2 ). Through the analysis of
our numerical experiments a coherent and physically intuitive picture emerges of how fast and slow MAG
aves interact within two-dimensional magneto-atmospheres.},
