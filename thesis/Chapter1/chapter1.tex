\section{The Sun} %Section - 1.1 
The Sun has been the subject of study by humanity since the dawn of civilisation.
The processes in the Sun and in its atmosphere have a direct impact on life on Earth.
The radiation that reaches the Earth provides the energy life needs to flourish and the interaction of the solar wind with the upper atmosphere generates the aurora.
Modern study of the Sun focuses on understanding the processes that drive changes in the Sun such as total radiation output and dramatic events such as solar flares or coronal mass ejections.

The properties and behaviour of the Sun change dramatically with distance from the centre of the Sun.
The core of the Sun is where the nuclear fusion reaction occurs, above this there is a region of plasma where energy transport by radiation dominates.
This radiative zone extends out to XXX, at that point a narrow region called the tachocline exists, where the plasma stops rotating as a solid body, and starts rotating with different velocities at different latitudes.
Above this tachocline radial energy transport is dominated by convective motions, this convective zone extends out to the visible surface or photosphere.
