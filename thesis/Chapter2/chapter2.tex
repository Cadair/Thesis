\section{Magnetohydrodynamics}\label{sec:MHD}

Ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) is the description of a plasma as a single perfectly conducting fluid.
This description of the plasma has certain constraints on it's validity, but as we will see, for the purposes of study in the thesis, the ideal MHD equations are a very applicable description of the plasma in the solar atmosphere.
The first and primary assumption of the nature of the plasma the MHD description makes is that it behaves like a fluid.
This means that there are very frequent collisions between the particles comprising the plasma.
Connected to this is the assumption that the temperature of the electrons and the ions are equal, implying that there are frequent interactions between the two species, and that the plasma can be treated as a single fluid.
Secondly, the MHD description is only valid in a certain window of temporal and length scales.
The characteristic length of the plasma has to be sufficiently large so that the particle motion around the magnetic field, the kinetic effects, can be ignored.
The temporal scales also have to be substantially longer than the frequency of the kinetic motions.
However, the temporal scale has to be short enough that the slow dissipative effects, such as resistive decay of the magnetic field, can be neglected.
Two other approximations are made, which enable the description of the plasma as a single fluid, these are the quasi-neutrality assumption, which is the assumption that there are very similar numbers of positive and negative charges present in the plasma; and the assumptions that the relative velocities of the positive and negative charges are small.
Finally, but very importantly, it is assumed that the plasma is non-relativistic, i.e. the motion of the plasma is substantially smaller than the speed of light.
The application of all these assumptions leads to a formulation of the equations governing the motion of the plasma based on Maxwells equations and the equations of gas dynamics, these are the ideal MHD equations, which are given below:
\newcommand{\condev}{\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial t} + \vec{v}\cdot\nabla\right)}
\begin{align}                                                         
    \dfrac{\partial \rho }{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\rho \vec{v}) =       
    0,
    \tag{Mass Conservation}\\
    %                               
    \rho  \condev\vec{v} + \nabla p - \dfrac{1}{\mu}(\nabla \times \vec{B}) \times \vec{B} - \rho \vec{g} = 0,
    \tag{Equation of Motion}\\
    %
    \frac{\partial}{\partial t} + \vec{v}\cdot\nabla p + \gamma p \nabla \cdot \vec{v}  = 0,
    \tag{Energy Equation}\\
    %
    \dfrac{\partial \mathrm{B}}{\partial t} - \nabla \times (\vec{v} \times \vec{B}) = 0,
    \tag{Induction Equation}               
\end{align}
subject to
\begin{align}
    \nabla \cdot \vec{B} = 0,
    \tag{Solenoid Equation}\\
    %
    p = \mathrm{k_B} \dfrac{\rho}{\mathrm{m}} \mathrm{T},
    \tag{Ideal Gas Law}\\                        
\end{align}
Where $\rho$ is the density, $\vec{v}$ is the velocity, $p$ is the pressure, $\gamma$ is the ratio of specific heats ($5/3$), $\vec{B}$ is the magnetic field, $\mathrm{k_B}$ is Boltzmann's constant, $\mathrm{m}$ is the mass, $\mathrm{T}$ is the temperature, and $\mu$ is the vacuum permeability \citep{goedbloed2004}.


\subsection{MHD Waves}\label{sec:MHDwaves}


\begin{align*}                                                         
    \vec{B} &= \vec{B}_0 + \vec{B}_1(\vec{r},t)\\               
    \vec{v} &= 0 + \vec{v}_1(\vec{r},t)\\               
    p &= p_0 + {p_1}(\vec{r},t)\\               
    \rho &= \rho_0 + {\rho_1}(\vec{r},t)\\              
\end{align*}
Here, subscripts are used to separate out the background ($\mathrm{B}_0$) and perturbation ($\mathrm{B}_1$) quantities.
There is assumed to be no background flow and that for all perturbations they are much smaller than the background value (e.g., $\mathrm{B}_0 \gg \mathrm{B}_1$).      
This leads to the linearised MHD equations,
\begin{align}                                                         
    \dfrac{\partial \rho_1 }{\partial t} + (\vec{v}_1 \cdot \nabla)\rho_0 + + \rho_0 (\nabla \cdot \vec{v}_1) =       
    0,
    \tag{Mass Conservation}\\
    %
    \rho_0 \dfrac{\partial \vec{v}_1}{\partial t} =
    -\nabla p_1 + \dfrac{1}{\mu}(\nabla \times \vec{B}_1) \times \vec{B}_0 + \rho_1 \vec{g},
    \tag{Equation of Motion}\\
    %
    \dfrac{\partial p_1}{\partial t} + (\vec{v}_1 \cdot \nabla)p_0 - c_s^2 \left( \dfrac{\partial \rho_1}{\partial t} + (\vec{v}_1 \cdot \nabla)\rho_0 \right) = 0,
    \tag{Energy Equation}\\
    %
    \dfrac{\partial \mathrm{B}_1}{\partial t} = \nabla \times (\vec{v}_1 \times \vec{B}_0),
    \tag{Induction Equation}\\
    %
    \nabla \cdot \vec{B}_1 = 0,
    \tag{Solenoid Equation}               
\end{align}
where we can define the first characteristic speed in MHD; the sound speed, $c_s^2 = \frac{\gamma p_0}{\rho_0}$.
There is another important characteristic speed and that is the Alfv\`{e}n speed, $c_A^2 = \frac{\mathrm{\underline{B}}_0^2}{\sqrt{\rho_0}}$.

\subsection{Velocity Perturbations}\label{sec:Vpert}

\subsection{Calculating Wave Flux}\label{sec:waveflux}


To calculate the relative strengths of the excited waves we compute the `wave energy flux' vector everywhere in the domain using Equation \ref{eq:wave_energy}.
\begin{equation}
\vec{F}_{wave} \equiv \widetilde{p}_k \vec{v} + \frac{1}{\mu_0} \left(\vec{B}_b \cdot \vec{\widetilde{B}}\right) \vec{v} - \frac{1}{\mu_0}\left(\vec{v} \cdot \vec{\widetilde{B}} \right) \vec{B}_b,
\label{eq:wave_energy}
\end{equation}
where a subscript $b$ represents a background variable, a tilda represents a perturbation from the background conditions and $p_k$ represents kinetic pressure.

This equation has been widely used to calculate the energy contained in linear MHD perturbations.
It is discussed in detail in \cite{bogdan2003} where it is compared to the `true' MHD flux for linear perturbations and found to be generally clearer. 
It is used in \cite{vigeesh2009, vigeesh2012, khomenko2012}. 
For a full derivation and discussion relating to time-averaging see \cite{leroy1985}.
Calculating wave energy flux using Equation \ref{eq:wave_energy} provides a vector which is useful in plotting time distance diagrams and analysing wave modes.
